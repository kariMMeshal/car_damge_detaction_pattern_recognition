# 🚗 Car Damage Detection with MobileNetV2

A deep learning project for detecting car damage using **MobileNetV2** and transfer learning, built and trained in **Google Colab**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Classifies car images into damage categories using transfer learning  
- Data augmentation for enhanced model generalization  
- Trained on a custom dataset sourced from **Kaggle**  
- Achieved robust accuracy on validation and test splits  
- Exports trained model (`.h5` file) for deployment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **MobileNetV2** (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- **OpenCV**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Kaggle API**
